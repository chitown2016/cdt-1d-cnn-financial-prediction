I was reading an article which applies a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to financial data and the authors claim the resulting strategy have very consistent profitability. You can read the article here: [Financial Markets Prediction with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05413) This sparked my interest so I've decided to replicate their results. I couldn't find the code for this model anywhere on the internet so I wrote it myself. I wrote to the authors about the code but nobody has yet go back to me.

## What are The Strategy Results Like?

The authors claim that applying their CNN model to Crude Oil futures yielded a 500% return over 71 months. This is approximately equal to a 43% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate). The strategy was profitable during 60 months of the 71 months. Below is a plot from the article.
